## 🎯 The Vision

For the growing class of Nigerian crypto-earners, Bundle is the financial super-app that acts as a universal router, allowing them to instantly spend their digital assets on any real-world service, from airtime to bank transfers, without ever touching a traditional off-ramp.

## 🔥 The Problem We Solve

Nigeria has one of the world's most vibrant crypto economies. Yet, using this digital value for daily life is slow, expensive, and complex. The bridge between Web3 earnings and real-world expenses is broken. Bundle fixes this.

## ✨ How It Works: The "OpenRouter" Magic

Bundle is a non-custodial web app built on Hedera. Our backend acts as an intelligent routing engine:
1.  **User Pays in Crypto:** A user initiates a payment for a N10,000 bank transfer using USDC.
2.  **Hedera Confirms:** We confirm the transaction in 2-3 seconds on the Hedera network.
3.  **Router Executes in Fiat:** Our backend instantly makes a N10,000 Naira payment to the recipient from our corporate account via the Paystack API.
4.  **The Result:** The recipient gets Naira instantly. They have no idea crypto was involved. It's fast, secure, and regulator-friendly.

## 🏆 A Multi-Track Winning Strategy

Bundle is designed as a super-app ecosystem to address all four hackathon tracks:
-   **Onchain Finance:** Flawless stablecoin off-ramping for real-world assets.
-   **DLT for Operations:** Our B2B API (vision) will automate corporate expenses.
-   **Immersive Experience:** Our roadmap includes NFT loyalty badges and DeFi savings vaults.
-   **AI & DePIN:** Our core moat is an AI-powered routing engine that ensures the cheapest, most reliable payment path.
